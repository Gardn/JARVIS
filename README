Welcome to the JARVIS 1.0 Tutorial.

This is only for Ubuntu 10.04, I have not tested it on other Distros 
or Operating Systems. Please Read this through before posting questions, 
this should be fairly simple.

Step By Step:
	1. Download the weather.py and startup.sh and put them both in your
home folder. (putting them elsewhere will require a bit of tweaking later.)
	2. Go to System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications. Uncheck the 
box for GDM Login Sound, as it would play over our little JARVIS. 
	3. Click add, and name the new command something like 'JARVIS startup'.
	4. In the command box type this command -> 
		sh -c "sleep 10; perl startup.sh
		#note: the 10 delays the sound for ten seconds at boot up. 
		I use this to give time for the internet connection to
		initialize before 
	5. logout and login to hear it, or to test, type the following command 
into a terminal to test it. --> perl startup.sh
